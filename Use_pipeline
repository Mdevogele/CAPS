1) Create the master dark 

CAPS_Bias.py ./Darks/*fits -o MasterDark_0s2.fits

2) Process the Standard stars images 

Create a folder with processed images 

mkdir Reduced_images

CAPS_Preproc.py ./Standard/*fits -b MasterDark_0s2.fits -o ./Reduced_Images/

3) Select star in images 

CAPS_SelectTarget ./Reduced_Images/*fits

-Click on the top star. The pipeline should then automatically detect all the stars.
-Press ‘z’ to detect the stars on all images.  
-Press ‘x’ to review all images and check if the stars have been well detected 
-Press ‘p’ to perform photometry. 

The pipeline then automatically write files containing the results for each individual images 

see: LoPol-HD39587_20190128T213937786_SC_V_0000s200_000000_Procc.fits.txt

-Press ‘q’ to exit

4) Analyse the photometry

CAPS_Anal.py ./Reduced_Images/*txt -plot -SS

-SS indicate that we are dealing with a standard star
-plot allows to plot the curve of growth.

Check on the plot the aperture where the curve of growth stabilizes.
When you close the figure, the pipeline will ask you what aperture to use. 

Here use 20 for example 

The pipeline will write two files with the Best_q and Best_u Stokes parameters and a files containing a summary of the results containing the JD, q, and u.

The reduction of the standard star is now done.
